## 📢 Use Openblocks in 3 steps
1. Connect to any data sources or APIs.
2. Build UI with 50+ components.
3. Share with colleagues and customers.
## 💡 Why Openblocks
It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.

Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.

Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.

Openblocks wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Openblocks is
- An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing apps.
- A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
- A domain-specific language that UI-configurable block is the first-class citizen.

## 🪄 Features
- **Visual UI builder** with 50+ built-in components.
- **Module and Query Library** for reusable components and queries in the UI builder.
- **Custom components** to share through React and Openblocks SDK (instead of iFrame). (Pre-alpha)
- **Native connections** to PostgresSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, RestAPI, SMTP, etc.
- **JavaScript supported everywhere** to transform data, control components, etc.
- **Embed Openblocks pages as a React component** (instead of iFrame).
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for granular permission management.
- **Auto-saved and restorable history** for release and version control.
- **DIY app themes** to precisely align with your company's content.
- **Audit logs** to track activities and ensure compliance.

## 🏆 Comparisons
### Openblocks vs Retool
- Openblocks is open-source. You don't need to worry about vendor lock-in or being stuck with an outdated version of the software.
- In Openblocks, developers can create and use their own components instead of depending on official updates.
- Openblocks supports left menu navigation (like most sites do). Retool has header navigation only.
### Openblocks vs Appsmith, Tooljet
- Openblocks has more components and richer configuration than Appsmith and Tooljet.
- In Openblocks, you can choose auto-height or fixed-height mode for your components, while Appsmith supports fixed-height mode only.
- In Openblocks, you can reuse common structures when building apps with modules and query library features.
